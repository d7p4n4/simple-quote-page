# simple-quote-page
This is my first page, which consits of 3 html pages. You can navigate between them with the three bottom, on the bottom of the page. Each html files contains tha same quote in another language, wich is writtwn on the buttons.

# Built with:
Html5
CSS

I built it in JSBin, and after it works in that, I created it with my desktop editor (brackets).
I used google fonts page, to link a new font-family.
